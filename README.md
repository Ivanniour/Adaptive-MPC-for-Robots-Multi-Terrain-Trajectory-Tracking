# Adaptive-Model-Prediction-Control-Based-Multi-Terrain-Trajectory-Tracking-for-Mobile-Robots
This project is related to our paper "Adaptive Model Prediction Control-Based Multi-Terrain Trajectory Tracking Framework for Mobile Spherical Robots" which is under rewiew, and enables robots to obtain uncertainties online and achieve multi-terrain trajectory tracking. 

The pseudocode of AN-MPC and VAN-MPC (proposed in the paper) can be seen as follows:
